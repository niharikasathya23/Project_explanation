## 1. Lightweight Dense Spatial Perception for Low-SWaP Robots
**Project Overview:**  
In this project, I developed **Bilateral Segmentation and Disparity Refinement (BSDR)**, a lightweight neural network for real-time spatial perception on low-SWaP robots. BSDR simultaneously performs pixel-wise segmentation and depth map refinement, improving 3D scene reconstruction in close-proximity scenarios. 

**Key Features:**
- Real-time inference at **11 FPS** on Luxonis OAK hardware
- Improved depth perception with reduced occlusion errors by **14.62%**
- Achieved an **89.89% mIoU** for segmentation tasks

## 2. StockWatch: Real-Time Big Data Pipeline for Stock Sentiment Analysis
**Project Overview:**  
A high-performance **Big Data pipeline** designed to process real-time stock-related tweets and analyze their sentiment to predict stock trends for **NYSE and NASDAQ** companies.

**Key Technologies:**
- **Kafka, PySpark, MongoDB, AWS**
- Sentiment analysis using **NLTK** and **spaCy**
- **<500ms processing latency**, handling 1000 tweets per hour

## 3. Movie Recommendation System
**Project Overview:**  
A **collaborative filtering-based recommendation system** for movies, designed using **FastAPI, ReactJS, and MongoDB**.

**Key Technologies and Features:**
- Dockerized for **expedited deployment** (25% reduction in deployment time)
- Scalable using **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** to handle **35% surge in concurrent users**

## 4. Automatic Hate Speech Detection Using Ensemble Methods
**Project Overview:**  
Developed an efficient social media **hate speech detection system** that classifies multi-class categories like **hate, offensive, and non-hate** texts using **Random Forest and Support Vector Classifiers (SVM)**.

**Key Results:**
- **90.7% accuracy**, outperforming traditional methods by **9.3%**
- Published at **IEEE NMITCON 2023**

## 5. Tequed Attendance Management App
**Project Overview:**  
A mobile app for managing attendance using **Android Studio and Java**. The app features a **customized UI/UX** and a robust backend with **Firebase** for real-time updates.

**Key Results:**
- Reduced manual tracking errors by **20%**
- Increased attendance record accuracy by **25%**
